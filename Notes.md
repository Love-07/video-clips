# Main Entry File
   The purpose of this file is to load Angular and load our app correctly.
   we load angular before we load our app

# Change Detection 
   Change Detection is the process of updating the HTML document whenever data changes in an app 
   --> When our app initalizes 
   --> during changes in the app 
   --> manually triggering change detection 

   Change detection run twice when an app is initalized , so we manually enable the prod mode where it runs only once during initalization 

# Module System
   The Goal of module system is to break code into separate files (this structure makes our code maintainable, reusable and testable)

# Components 
   These are like reusable HTML Tags with custom behaviour, (these are kind of new tag which we teached browser)

# MVC Pattern 
   Model-> it represents the data in the component 
   View-> it represents the appearnce of the component 
   controller->it represents the business logic of the component 

   controller can be treated like a middle man between the model and the view
